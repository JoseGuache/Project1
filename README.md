# Song Searcher

## Description

For our project, we created a website that allows users to search for an artist and their song, presenting both the song and its lyrics. Our project utilizes both the Spotify API and a lyrics API. We chose Pico CSS as our CSS framework because it offers a minimal yet stylish design.
